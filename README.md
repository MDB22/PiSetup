# PiSetup
Installation script for setting up the working environment for a Raspberry Pi, after installing Raspbian.

To run, use "./setup.sh" in the directory holding the file, or use "bash *path to file*/setup.sh".

This script will update the firmware and packages on the Raspberry Pi, then install Python packages, and a Python virtual environment for easy project management. The user's profile will be configured to boot into the virtual environment in the desired project folder.

Currently, this setup script is targeted for the setup of an onboard computer for a UAV.
